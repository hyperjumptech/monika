To put it simply, it’s pretty much like Postman.</p><p>If we compare it with Postman, it doesn’t have such glamorous features as <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/use-existing-postman-collections-with-monika-an-alternative-solution-to-postman-monitoring-770572eedb2c\">Postman collections monitoring</a>. Of course, because Insomnia is just an API client and design tool, we understand. But guess who can do API monitoring besides Postman? Monika. In the latest version of Monika, you can run Monika with Insomnia collection.</p><p>This article will show you how to use your existing Insomnia collections with Monika so you can create your own “Insomnia collections monitoring” at home. So, without further ado:</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2F3ohzdD58rieeeS538c%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&display_name=Giphy&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F3ohzdD58rieeeS538c%2Fgiphy.gif&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F3ohzdD58rieeeS538c%2Fgiphy.gif&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=giphy\" width=\"435\" height=\"242\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/719a03e1330b5d7ce8feee05e3b59ab6/href\">https://medium.com/media/719a03e1330b5d7ce8feee05e3b59ab6/href</a></iframe><h3>Run Insomnia Collection with Monika</h3><p><a href=\"https://monika.hyperjump.tech\">Monika</a></p><p>What is Monika? Monika is an open-source and free synthetic monitoring command-line application. The name Monika stands for “<strong>Moni</strong>toring Ber<strong>ka</strong>la”, which means “periodic monitoring” in the Indonesian language.</p><p>With Monika, you can add as many websites as you want to monitor. You can monitor several conditions such as service outages or slow services. Also, you can configure Monika to send notifications of the incidents on your services through your favorite communication tools like SMTP mail, Telegram, <a href=\"https://whatsapp.hyperjump.tech/\"><strong>WhatsApp</strong></a> (It’s free!), etc.</p><p>Install Monika via npm install -g @hyperjumptech/monika or if you don’t have NPM in your system, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperjumptech/monika/releases\">download the prebuilt binary from our release page</a>. After installing Monika, run monika -v to verify your Monika installation.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/530/1*NCa_JT4SdiaDPPdHgIzq2Q.png\" /><figcaption>Example of Monika version</figcaption></figure><h4>Export your Insomnia Collection</h4><p>If you don’t have any Insomnia collection, let’s try to create one. Open Insomnia, and navigate to the <strong>Create</strong> button at the top right of the window. Then, select a <strong>Request Collection</strong>. Enter the desired name for the collection, and click <strong>Create</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*22NyPUhQEBzYw9hnIu0Fhw.png\" /><figcaption>Example created collection</figcaption></figure><p>Then, proceed to add a new request by clicking the plus button on the top left of the window and clicking the <strong>New Request </strong>option. Give the request a name. Then, let’s try to add a simple GET request, with the URL using a mock REST API (e.g <a href=\"https://reqres.in/api/users\">https://reqres.in/api/users</a>), and click <strong>Send</strong>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ltu-chR2G8eWDSHjnJXqaw.png\" /><figcaption>Example response of the <a href=\"https://reqres.in/api/users\">https://reqres.in/api/users</a></figcaption></figure><p>Now that we can confirm that the API is working, let’s export the collection by clicking the caret down icon beside the collection name at the top left of the window and selecting the <strong>Import/Export </strong>option. Then, click the <strong>Export Data</strong> button and select <strong>Export the “Your collection name” Collection</strong>. After that, select the requests you want to export, select the format to Insomnia <strong>export version 4</strong> (JSON/YAML), select the destination folder, and you’re halfway done!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/661/1*LUN8aYgrX0no8q5dCUSfOQ.png\" /><figcaption>Example of exporting data</figcaption></figure><h4><strong>Running Monika with exported Insomnia collections</strong></h4><p>Now that you have installed Monika and exported your Insomnia collection, it’s time to run your API monitoring using Monika.

Now you can use Monika as an Insomnia Monitoring, just like Postman!</p><h3><strong>Closing</strong></h3><p>Insomnia is another popular REST client that can be used for testing RESTful as well as GraphQL APIs. Because of its simplicity, it may not have such features as collection monitoring like Postman. Using Monika, you can monitor your Insomnia collection just like Postman Monitoring with just one line of command.</p><p>If you’re having a problem with using Monika, don’t hesitate to create an issue on <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperjumptech/monika/issues\">Monika’s Github Issue Page</a>.

Symon adalah <em>dashboard monitoring tool </em>yang menggunakan Monika di belakangnya.</p><p>Salah satu hal yang terjadi selama beberapa hari saat mengembangkan Symon adalah seringnya halaman aplikasi web Symon kami mengalami <em>downtime</em>, yang disebabkan oleh server kami kehabisan memori.</p><p>Kami awalnya mengkonfigurasi server Symon dengan memori 4 GB, jadi apa hal pertama yang harus dilakukan ketika memori penuh? Secara intuitif, kami pasti menambahkan lebih banyak RAM, jadi kami meningkatkan RAM server kami ke 8 GB. Tapi apakah itu menyelesaikan masalah? Sayangnya tidak, karena server kami masih kekurangan memori.</p><p>Jadi, kami mencari apa yang salah dan menemukan bahwa masalah utamanya adalah server kami menampilkan aplikasi web Symon dan memproses data laporan <em>instance </em>Monika di satu server secara bersamaan.</p><p>Sebagai gambaran, berikut adalah <em>flow </em>saat ini di Symon:</p><ul><li>Suatu <em>instance </em>Monika melaporkan data <em>probe</em> dengan melakukan <em>request </em>API ke Symon</li><li>Symon menerima <em>request </em>dan memprosesnya langsung</li><li>Symon mengembalikan hasil respon dari API</li><li>Jika Symon membutuhkan waktu lebih lama untuk memproses data laporan <em>probe</em>, Symon akan mengalami macet saat memproses data masuk lainnya.</li></ul><p>Ini menjadi masalah karena data laporan <em>probe</em> yang diberikan kepada Symon bisa memakan waktu lama untuk diproses mengingat ukurannya yang cukup besar. Jadi kita perlu memisahkan aplikasi web dan pemrosesan data laporan pengujian untuk mengurangi beban server. Pertanyaan besarnya adalah: <strong>bagaimana caranya?</strong></p><p>Tim kami memutuskan bahwa kami <strong>HANYA</strong> harus membuat <em>worker </em>untuk menangani data laporan <em>probe</em>, dan itu harus dipisahkan dari kode aplikasi web utama. Pada Symon API yang awalnya memproses data, kita perlu mengubahnya menjadi hanya menambahkan data ke <em>queue</em> yang sedang diproses oleh <em>worker</em>.</p><p>Teman kami <a href=\"https://medium.com/@kevin-hyperjump\">Kevin Hermawan</a> mengusulkan suatu <em>library </em>bernama <a href=\"https://optimalbits.github.io/bull/\"><strong>Bull</strong></a>, sebuah <em>library </em>berbasis NodeJS yang mengimplementasikan sistem <em>queue</em> yang cepat dan kuat menggunakan <a href=\"https://redis.io/\"><strong>Redis</strong></a>. Dengan menggunakan Bull, kita dapat membuat <em>queue</em> untuk menerima <em>job</em> dari API, menyimpan <em>job</em> di Redis dan juga membuat <em>worker </em>untuk memproses <em>job</em> dalam <em>queue</em>.</p><p>Tanpa basa-basi, kami mengeksekusi ide ini. Kami membaca bagaimana Bull dapat membatasi <em>job</em> yang diproses dalam waktu dan durasi tertentu, mengatur <em>delay</em> antara <em>job</em> yang sedang diproses dan apa yang harus dilakukan ketika suatu <em>job </em>selesai. Akhirnya, file <em>worker </em>kami telah selesai:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/e732c45326a6ec429868d9905be87176/href\">https://medium.com/media/e732c45326a6ec429868d9905be87176/href</a></iframe><p>Lalu kami membuat satu server tambahan, menginstal Redis, dan men<em>deploy</em> <em>worker </em>yang sudah dibuat sebelumnya. Setelah proses <em>deploy </em>selesai, kami mendapat log yang mengatakan bahwa <em>report queue </em>telah terhubung ke Redis. <em>So far so good.</em></p><p>Kembali ke API, kami harus memindahkan semua logika bisnis kami dari API ke dalam blok “<em>report queue job processor</em>” di file <em>worker</em>, dan kami membuat perubahan pada kodingan API kami:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8173700749efc9a216737d35a42f1c7d/href\">https://medium.com/media/8173700749efc9a216737d35a42f1c7d/href</a></iframe><p>Jadi, API yang dulu menangani pemrosesan data yang masuk dari Monika sekarang hanya menambahkan suatu <em>job </em>ke <em>queue</em> berisikan data dari Monika, dan data yang ditambahkan ke <em>queue </em>diproses oleh <em>worker</em>.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/959/1*gb5mQ4idOSezpQoYmeIzrg.png\" /><figcaption>Worker memproses job dari queue</figcaption></figure><p>Menggunakan skema ini, kami berhasil mengurangi beban server secara signifikan.

Karena di atas langit masih ada Hotman Paris. <em>Eh, </em>maksud kami masih ada langit.</p><p>Kami masih bereksperimen dengan mengoptimalkan kinerja pemrosesan data Monika, terutama ketika kami menemukan bahwa Bull memiliki pembaruan yang disebut <a href=\"https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq\">BullMQ</a>, versi terbaru dari Bull yang seluruhnya ditulis dalam TypeScript.</p><p>Kami juga masih mempertimbangkan solusi yang lebih baik tanpa menggunakan Redis, mungkin dengan menggunakan database SQL sederhana untuk menyimpan pekerjaan dan menggunakan <a href=\"https://github.com/breejs/bree\">Bree</a> sebagai <em>job scheduler</em>.

Symon is a dashboard monitoring tool powered by Monika.</p><p>One of the things that happened for a few days while developing Symon is the frequent downtime of our Symon web page caused by our server is being out of memory.</p><p>We initially configure the Symon server using 4GBs of memory, so what’s the first thing to do when it comes to out-of-memory? Intuitively, you add more RAM. So we upgraded our server to 8GBs of memory. Does it fix the problem? Unfortunately, it doesn’t, because our server is still out-of-memory.</p><p>So we troubleshoot what went wrong, and we found out that the root cause of the problem is that Symon is serving the web app and handling the probe report data from our Monika instance in one server.</p><p>Let me paint you a picture of our current flow at Symon:</p><ul><li>Monika instance will hit Symon API with the probe report data</li><li>Symon then will process the data and save it to the database</li><li>Symon return the API response</li><li>If Symon took a longer time to process the probe report data, it will be stuck while processing another incoming data.</li></ul><p>This is an issue because the probe report data could take a long time to process because they are pretty large in terms of size. So, we need to separate the web app serving and the probe report data processing to reduce the server load. The big question is, <strong>how?</strong></p><p>Our team decided that we should build a “worker” application <strong>ONLY</strong> for processing probe report data, and it should be separated from the main web app code. On the Symon API that originally process the data, we should change it to only add the data to the queue that will be processed by the worker.</p><p>Our colleague <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/dennypradipta/2d496958ac9d20155f2f59205b8d2750\">Kevin Hermawan</a> proposed a library called <a href=\"https://optimalbits.github.io/bull/\"><strong>Bull</strong></a>, a Node library that implements a fast and robust queue system based on <a href=\"https://redis.io/\"><strong>Redis</strong></a>. By using Bull, we can create a Bull queue to accept jobs from the API, store the jobs into Redis, and also create a Bull worker to process the jobs in the queue.</p><p>So without further ado, we execute this idea. We read about how Bull can limit jobs processed in a time and its duration, set delays between jobs processed, and what to do when the job is complete. We came up with this single file for our worker:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/e732c45326a6ec429868d9905be87176/href\">https://medium.com/media/e732c45326a6ec429868d9905be87176/href</a></iframe><p>So we spin up a server, install Redis, and deploy our worker into the server. After deploying, we got a log saying that our report queue is connected to our Redis. So far so good.</p><p>Now onto our existing API. We have to move all our business logic in the API into the “report queue job processor” block in the worker file, and we made changes to our existing API to this:</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/8173700749efc9a216737d35a42f1c7d/href\">https://medium.com/media/8173700749efc9a216737d35a42f1c7d/href</a></iframe><p>So basically, the API that previously process the incoming data now only adds the data into the queue. And the data that has been added to the queue will be processed by the worker.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/959/1*gb5mQ4idOSezpQoYmeIzrg.png\" /><figcaption>Worker processing jobs from the queue</figcaption></figure><p>Using this schema, we were able to reduce our loads significantly. Our Symon web app that crashes frequently now is pretty stable, and the worker is running smoothly too!</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/961/1*_wpXn55rGdeFkoOcSVUNcw.png\" /><figcaption>Our web app available Memory</figcaption></figure><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/959/1*DQLj-8yrB1JUPWuaSiEgNQ.png\" /><figcaption>Our worker available Memory</figcaption></figure><h3>Closing</h3><p>We finally managed to reduce the server load by separating the probe report data processing with the web app serving process. But is this the final answer to this problem? While we are satisfied with the web app not being out of memory, we are still not satisfied as we still can do better than this.</p><p>We are still experimenting on optimizing Symon probe report data processing performance, especially when we found out that Bull has an update called <a href=\"https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq\">BullMQ</a> which is the major version of Bull written entirely in Typescript.</p><p>Also, we are still considering a better solution without using Redis at all, probably by using a simple SQL database to store jobs and using <a href=\"https://github.com/breejs/bree\">Bree</a> as a job scheduler.

We notice that our Monika has stopped running the night before. We try to restart it a couple of times a few days earlier, but it stops running again the next day.</p><p>The first thing we wanted to know is what has caused Monika to stop. We were then scrapping out the logs and found no abnormal activities, but we notice that Monika has suddenly stopped at one moment in time. We have to check what’s happened with the surroundings also at that time.</p><p>We then try to isolate Monika by running it on an ubuntu server and monitor of its CPU and memory usage. Our tool of choice is <a href=\"https://clinicjs.org\"><strong>Clinicjs</strong></a>, an open-source tool for diagnosing and pinpointing NodeJS based apps performance issues. It also has a beautiful report screen with descriptions and suggestions, more than enough for our current needs.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/984/1*NXci3IrqPxfwwmQhHRCPuA.png\" /><figcaption>clinic js doctor’s reading from Monika performance</figcaption></figure><p>After a couple of minutes of monitoring, we found that there were multiple spikes of CPU usage, a slight increase in memory, and a significant increase in the number of active handles.</p><p>The Clinicjs gives us multiple readings on the performance of the application and server environments. First, it gives you the CPU Usage chart reading, the picture above is showing a very high percentage number. The next chart is giving you the memory usage, it shows a subtle increase in memory usage during the time we ran Monika.</p><p>The other two charts are showing the application events and active handles. The event loop delays, giving reports on how much time it takes for the recurring events. Event loop delays show a steady number of events and delays. The active handles show the number of handles running at the time. The active handles chart above shows us a significant increase in the number of processes happening at one time.</p><p>The report is also giving out warnings for a potential I/O issue. There are long-running asynchronous activities and it identifies that the problem was not in the node modules but rather in I/O operations.</p><p>Considering Monika's functions and behaviors, several I/O processes are running simultaneously. Multiple intervals are set for running probes, reporting results to Symon, and fetching any new configurations set from it.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/864/1*2swKSc79sTD_S4O8dNEHhA.png\" /><figcaption>Monika’s logs on reporting to Symon with a memory problem</figcaption></figure><p>We were then back to scrutinizing Monika's log, focusing on the I/O processes. At a glance, it shows nothing wrong but when we look closely, the debug log only registered a single entry in which Monika is reporting to Symon before running the probe. While it is also supposed to be logging the number of requests and notifications that have been reported and then deleting the items that have been reported from the local database, as shown below.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/864/1*MOM7Enfr6Afc4JXgz9yK-w.png\" /><figcaption>Monika’s logs on reporting to Symon successfully</figcaption></figure><p>From this, we know that the reporting process from Monika to Symon has not been successfully finished and the requests are still hanging without any response from Symon. This causes the buildup of memories usage on top of the existing reporting process, creating multiple processes running at one time. Over time it would use up the server memory. By this time, we were also having another issue in Symon. We found out that Symon has also been restarting itself a few times in a couple of days.</p><p>We were implementing a new library for queuing the report-saving process in Symon a few weeks before, based on Redis queueing system. It went well for a couple of weeks, but with the increase of Monika's instances connecting to Symon, the Redis has reached its initial memory state limit and stopped. This is what then could be identified as the root cause of Symon restarting itself in the last few days.</p><p>When Symon is restarting, Monika will stop running. To stop this issue from happening again, we were implementing some fixes to Monika, to pause the reporting process and probes interval when it has no connections to Symon. Monika will be checking on Symon and fetch configurations every 60 seconds. So, if Symon is suddenly stopped then restarted, Monika will try to reconnect to Symon after 60 seconds, while continuing its probing and reporting functions.</p><p>We were finally able to hunt down the performance issue in Monika using Clinic js. An excellent tool that helped us show where the issue was, after which we can analyze what processes have caused it and set rules for asserting it.</p><p><a href=\"https://hyperjump.tech\"><strong>Hyperjump</strong></a> is an open-source-first company providing engineering excellence service.

Memasang monitor untuk penggunaan <em>memori</em> dan <em>CPU</em> nya. Aplikasi yang kita gunakan untuk itu adalah <a href=\"https://clinicjs.org\"><strong>clinicjs</strong></a>, sebuah aplikasi <em>open-source</em> untuk mendiagnosa performa dan menunjukkan lokasi masalah pada aplikasi yang berbasis nodejs.

Dari pengamatan selama beberapa menit, kami sudah dapat menemukan angka yang sangat tinggi terhadap penggunaan <em>CPU</em>, penggunaan memori yang pelan-pelan meningkat dan angka yang sangat signifikan terhadap jumlah <em>active handles</em>.</p><p>Pertama-tama ia menampilkan diagram penggunaan <em>CPU.</em> Pada gambar diatas terlihat jumlah pengunaan dengan persentase yang tinggi. Diagram selanjutnya menampilkan penggunaan memori dimana angkanya perlahan-lahan meningkat pada saat monika dijalankan.</p><p>Dua diagram lainnya menunjukkan jumlah <em>event loop delays </em>dan <em>active handle</em>. Diagram <em>event loop delays</em>, menampilkan lamanya jeda waktu yang di butuhkan untuk menjalankan proses berulang tersebut. Diatas terlihat jeda yang stabil antar event yang dijalankan. Diagram <em>active handles</em> menampilkan jumlah <em>handle</em> yang sedang dijalankan pada saat itu.

Monika menjalankan beberapa interval untuk menjalankan <em>probes</em>, melaporkan hasil <em>response</em> probe ke Symon dan mengambil konfigurasi baru dari Symon.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/864/1*2swKSc79sTD_S4O8dNEHhA.png\" /><figcaption>Log Monika pada saat terjadi masalah</figcaption></figure><p>Kami kemudian kembali membaca log dari Monika dan fokus terhadap proses <em>I/O</em> nya. Sekilas tidak terlihat ada sesuatu yang salah, tapi kalau kita perhatikan lagi di dalam log, <em>debug</em> hanya tertulis satu kali pada saat Monika melaporkan datanya ke Symon, sebelum ia kemudian menjalankan kembali probe nya. Dimana ia seharusnya menuliskan juga jumlah <em>request</em> dan notifikasi yang telah dilaporkan, yang kemudian menghapusnya dari basis data lokal seperti yang terlihat di bawah.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/864/1*MOM7Enfr6Afc4JXgz9yK-w.png\" /><figcaption>Log Monika yang seharusnya</figcaption></figure><p>Dari kedua data di atas bisa kita ketahui bahwa proses pengiriman laporan data dari Monika ke Symon belum selesai secara sempurna dan <em>request</em> yang dikirim masih menunggu <em>response</em> dari Symon. <em>Request</em> yang belum selesai ini kemudian tertimpa oleh <em>request</em> yang baru, hal ini akan menyebabkan penumpukan jumlah penggunaan memori pada server. Pada saat yang sama juga muncul masalah pada Symon. Team kami mendapati bahwa symon telah beberapa kali mengalami <em>application restart </em>selama beberapa hari sebelumnya.</p><p>Beberapa minggu sebelumnya, kami telah menambahkan sebuah library yang menggunakan sistem antrian <em>redis</em> untuk membantu proses penyimpanan laporan pada Symon. Sistem tersebut telah berjalan dengan baik selama beberapa minggu, namun seiring bertambahnya jumlah Monika yang terhubung dengan Symon, jumlah awal memori yang dialokasikan untuk redis tidak lagi mampu menampung laporan yang terkirim dan tiba-tiba berhenti. Hal ini juga yang menyebabkan Symon mengalami <em>restart </em>beberapa hari belakangan ini.</p><p>Apabila Symon <em>restart</em>, maka Monika akan ikut mati juga. Agar tidak terjadi lagi, kami menambahkan beberapa perbaikan pada Monika. Monika akan menghentikan proses pelaporan data dan <em>interval probe</em> apabila koneksi ke Symon terputus. Dengan demikian tidak akan ada lagi proses penumpukan <em>request </em>dan memori yang akan menyebabkan Monika mati.</p><p>Monika juga memiliki interval untuk melakukan pengecekan terhadap Symon, yang akan berjalan setiap 60 detik. Jadi, apabila Symon tiba-tiba berhenti dan restart, maka Monika akan mencoba untuk menghubungkan kembali dirinya ke Symon.
