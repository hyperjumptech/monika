All there’s left is to create a Pull Request to our Monika repository.</p><h3>Closing</h3><p>One of the advantages of Monika is that Monika is open-source, meaning you can easily check out the source code. Better yet, you can contribute to Monika's development by helping us cover up all the notification channels that exist in this world.</p><p>If you’re having a problem with using Monika, don’t hesitate to create an issue on <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperjumptech/monika/issues\">Monika’s Github Issue Page</a>.

Let’s say that you <a href=\"https://monika.hyperjump.tech/guides/notifications\">use all 15 Monika notifications channel</a>, and has a lot of projects. You can run Monika like so:</p><p>monika -c project-a.yml project-b.yml project-c.yml notifications.yml</p><p>So that you can still probe project A, project B, and project C, with all notifications channels from the notifications.yml configuration.</p><p>Congratulations! Now you can run Monika using multiple configurations!</p><h3>Closing</h3><p>The concept of modularizing the configurations is pretty handy when you have a lot of projects to probe, with the same notification channels. You can also separate notifications and probes so you can ensure that if there are changes in the configurations, the changes are according to the scope you’re working on (e.g only fix the probes without changing the notifications).

This is a good starting point for those who want to use synthetic monitoring tools.</li><li><strong>HTTP/TCP request</strong><br>Both Monika and EaseProbe can do an HTTP or TCP request to check the health of the service.</li><li><strong>Various notifications channel can be used multiple times<br></strong>Monika and EaseProbe have a wide range of notification channels, and we can configure the notification to use as many channels as we want to. The only difference is the notification channel selection.</li><li><strong>SLA Report<br></strong>Monika has the feature called “<a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/get-your-daily-summary-of-your-monika-instances-using-status-notification-89a07b10af18\">Status Notification</a>” which will send you the report of your probe performance based on your configured CRON timings. EaseProbe has a similar feature, the only difference is that it uses human time (weekly, daily, etc.)</li><li><strong>Logfile<br></strong>Both Monika and EaseProbe has logging. Monika uses SQLite and EaseProbe uses a simple stdout log with log rotation.</li></ul><h4>Pros and Cons</h4><h4>Monika</h4><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Wider notifications channels</strong><br>Monika has fifteen including WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, and Custom Webhooks while EaseProbe has nine notification channels</li><li><strong>Export data to Prometheus<br></strong>Monika can <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/collecting-monika-with-prometheus-9faa7d484a30\">export the log to Prometheus</a> and users can <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/visualizing-monika-data-with-prometheus-and-grafana-bee8c6feb9d3\">visualize the report using Grafana.</a></li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Can only do HTTP/TCP requests</strong><br>Monika can only do health checks by HTTP/TCP requests, while EaseProbe can utilize native clients such as MySQL, Redis to run a check, and SSH.</li><li><strong>No log rotation</strong><br>Log rotation is an automated process to handle log files in a certain timespan (weekly, monthly, etc.) in order to keep the log file from growing too large. EaseProbe has the powerful log rotation feature while Monika does not. If you want the log rotation feature in Monika, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperjumptech/monika/issues\">submit an issue on the Monika issue page</a>.</li><li><strong>Cannot use mTLS</strong><br>Monika does not have the <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-tls/\">mTLS or Mutual TLS</a> feature, while EaseProbe can use mTLS in the HTTP or native client health checks.</li></ul><h4>EaseProbe</h4><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shell, SSH, and Client (MySQL, Redis, MongoDB) probing<br></strong>Aside from HTTP and TCP requests, EaseProbe can probe shells, SSHs, and native clients such as MySQL, Redis, and MongoDB</li><li><strong>Host resource usage monitoring<br></strong>EaseProbe can also monitor your host resource usage such as CPU, RAM, and Disk usage so that it will send you a notification when it reaches a certain threshold.</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>No option to export to Prometheus<br></strong>EaseProbe does not have an option to export to Prometheus, so it could not visualize the data.</li><li><strong>Can not chain request<br></strong>EaseProbe can not chain HTTP requests in one go, e.g hit the login API, then check the dashboard API using the token from the login API. Monika can use <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/be-alerted-when-your-authentication-api-is-slow-with-monika-a-guide-for-chaining-request-a63801df8b39\">the previous request’s response body for the next request.</a></li><li><strong>Does not support HAR/Postman/Insomnia collection probing<br></strong>EaseProbe supported many types of health checks but it can not use existing HAR/Postman/Insomnia collection probing. Monika can monitor your existing <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/generate-your-monika-configuration-using-http-archive-har-764944cbb9e6\">HAR</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/use-existing-postman-collections-with-monika-an-alternative-solution-to-postman-monitoring-770572eedb2c\">Postman</a>, or <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/use-existing-insomnia-collections-with-monika-to-monitor-your-apis-4abc0e608348\">Insomnia</a> collection.</li><li><strong>No TLS checker<br></strong>EaseProbe does not have an in-built TLS expiry date checker so users couldn’t get notification about their TLS certificates expiring in 30 days. <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/forgot-to-renew-the-tls-certificates-monika-will-remind-you-from-now-on-188407c484ba\">Monika will remind you if your TLS certificates are expiring soon</a>.</li></ul><h3>Summary</h3><p>Both Monika and EaseProbe have the same purpose: to ensure that your services are working and healthy. Both software served the purpose well and it’s up to you to decide which synthetic monitoring tools you would like to use based on your requirements.</p><p>We do have ideas to improve Monika based on EaseProbe such as native client probing and host resources usage monitoring. That’s what open-source software development should be, isn’t it great?</p><p>If you like this article don’t forget to clap and share this with your friends. If you think we miss something, drop your comments below. That way, hopefully, EaseProbe folks will notice us :)</p><p>That’s it for today, see you in the next article!</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2F42D3CxaINsAFemFuId%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&display_name=Giphy&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F42D3CxaINsAFemFuId%2Fgiphy.gif&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F42D3CxaINsAFemFuId%2Fgiphy.gif&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=giphy\" width=\"435\" height=\"435\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/1da178dc8c3becf11dbd54cd77486949/href\">https://medium.com/media/1da178dc8c3becf11dbd54cd77486949/href</a></iframe><p><a href=\"https://github.com/hyperjumptech\">Hyperjump</a></p><p><a href=\"https://hyperjump.tech/\">Hyperjump</a> is an open-source-first company providing engineering excellence service.
