## Motivation

It goes without saying, whether a front facing website or a backend service, everyone would like their services to be attractive, high performing and practically bombproof. Great design, engineeering excellence and proper processes will contribute in these goals. Not to be overlooked is the major role tooling has on project succeses, during development and long after deployment. Sadly tooling are not alway budgeted, often treated as something "nice to have" rather than "essential to have". This is where our motivation begin. We believe great tools should go hand in hand, with great teams and proper processes.
