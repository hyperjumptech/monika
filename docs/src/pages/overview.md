Monika is an open source and free synthetic monitoring command line application. The name Monika stands for "**Moni**toring Ber**ka**la", which means "periodic monitoring" in the Indonesian language.

## How it works

Monika operates by reading everything from a config file. Based on the configuration it will build and send out http requests. If the request response is not as expected, Monika will generate an alert. The alert can be sent via various notification channel (email, webhook, telegram, whatsapp, etc.).

For more information, please refer to the detailed documentations below.

## Motivation

Anyone who has created a website or a backend service would want them to be fast, robust and perform well all the time. Good design, engineering excellence and proper processes will contribute to these goals. Yet, what is often overlooked is the importance monitoring tools have on a project's success. Hence the budget for some type of monitoring tool is often marked as optional rather than a must have. This is our motivation. Proper monitoring tools must be setup from the very beginning. Any development team should integrate monitoring tools in their development process. Then they should extend it into production deployment.

With this in mind, we created Monika, a synthetic monitoring tool.

## Not just another tool

There are plenty of free monitoring tools online, but many fall short of our requirements. Free uptime monitors exists, but they only ping for service availability. Most users don't use services only with pings. There are also plenty of real time monitoring tools. These tools need real users, which make them less suitable during development. Monika however, can synthesize usage scenarios during development, and you can use the same scenarios in production. Synthetic monitoring tool enable you to generate complex usage flows for quality assurance. Those same flows later on can be deployed to check the production environment. All without the need to install agents or third party libraries.

In addition, Monika is easy to deploy. You can deploy Monika to multiple servers in different locations. Afterwards, Monika can generate and send notifications if any of those location experience service degradation. All these features are available for free.

## Open source

Monika is open sourced. How many of you click the "Pricing" menu every time after reading the feature page of a new product? Since Monika is open sourced, we are removing barrier for budget strapped teams. Monika's source code is always open for inspection.
