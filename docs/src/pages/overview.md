## Motivation

It goes without saying, whether a front facing website or a backend service, everyone would like their services to be attractive, performant and practiclly bombproof. Great design, engineeering excellence and proper processes will contribute in these goals. Not to be overlooked is the importance tooling has on project succeses. Sadly good tools are not alway budgeted, often relegated to something "nice to have" rather than "essential to have". This is our motivation. We believe the proper tools should go hand in hand with great teams and proper engineering processes. We belive tooling should be integrated with the development process and extend after deployment
