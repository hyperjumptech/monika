This tutorial will show you how to integrate Monika with Pushover to get your Monika notifications through your Pushover clients.

## Setup Pushover

To use Pushover with Monika, head to [https://pushover.net](https://pushover.net) and create an account. Then, you need to confirm your email. After that, log in to the dashboard and pay attention to the “**Your User Key**”. Save the user key to a safe place as we are going to need it later.

Then, scroll down to the bottom of the page. Click the **Create a new Application/API Token**. Fill out the forms, and click **Create Application**. You should see your **API Token/Key.** Save the token to a safe place as we are going to need it later.

After you created the API Token, go back to the main Dashboard. Then, click the **Add Phone, Tablet, or Desktop**. For this case, use the **Pushover for Desktop**. Then, enter your Device Name and click **Register Web Browser**. You will be redirected to your created Pushover desktop client.

Once that’s done, it’s time to configure Monika to integrate with the Pushover desktop client.

## Integrate Monika with Pushover

Now that we have our User and API Token from Pushover, it’s time to create a Monika configuration called `monika.yml`

```
notifications:
  - id: pushover-notification
    type: pushover
    data:
      token: <YOUR_PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN>
      user: <YOUR_PUSHOVER_USER_KEY>
probes:
  - id: 6a31bcff-48f1-40b0-98aa-8c7610f4f428
    name: Localhost
    description: ''
    requests:
      - url: http://localhost:8080/health
        method: GET
        headers: {}
        body: '{}'
        timeout: 0
    alerts:
      - query: response.status < 200 or response.status > 299
        message: HTTP Status is not 200
      - query: response.time > 2000
        message: Response time is more than 2000ms
    incidentThreshold: 3
    recoveryThreshold: 3
```

Let’s take a look at the configuration above:

- The Pushover notification channel will use the API Token and User Key you created from the previous step.
- It will probe [http://localhost:8080/health,](https://www.google.com%2C/) with the method GET
- It will alert you if the response status code is not 200, or the response time is longer than two seconds
- The incident/recovery threshold count is 3, meaning Monika will only send notifications when the probed URL returns non-2xx status 3 times in a row. After sending the notifications, Monika will not send notifications anymore until the alert status changes.

Once that’s done, run Monika with the configuration above with the command `monika -c monika.yml`

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Monika with Pushover! Note that Pushover integration is only available from the Monika version 1.8.0.
