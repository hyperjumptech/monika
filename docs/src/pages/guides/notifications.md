## Notification Types

Monika will send notifications to you whenever [alerts](https://hyperjumptech.github.io/monika/guides/alerts) are triggered, e.g., when the response status of a probed URL is not [2xx success code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_success) ([status-not-2xx](https://hyperjumptech.github.io/monika/guides/alerts#1-http-code)).

At this moment, Monika supports 4 types of notificationsâ€”smtp, webhook, Mailgun, and Sendgrid. We are working on more notifications like Microsoft Teams, Telegram, and many more. You can help!

## Configurations

To use one or more notifications, you need to define the settings in the config.json file as shown below.

```json
"notifications": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id-mailgun",
      "type": "mailgun",
      "data": {
        "recipients": ["RECIPIENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS"],
        "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "domain": "YOUR_DOMAIN"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "unique-id-sendgrid",
      "type": "sendgrid",
      "data": {
        "recipients": ["RECIPIENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS"],
        "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "unique-id-smtp",
      "type": "smtp",
      "data": {
        "recipients": ["RECIPIENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS"],
        "hostname": "SMTP_HOSTNAME",
        "port": 587,
        "username": "SMTP_USERNAME",
        "password": "SMTP_PASSWORD"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "unique-id-webhook",
      "type": "webhook",
      "data": {
        "method": "POST",
        "url": "https://WEBHOOK_URL"
      }
    }
  ],
```

Note that every triggered alert will be sent to you through all the notifications you defined in the config.json, e.g., if you added `webhook` and `smtp` settings, you will receive the alert messages through both.

## SMTP

[SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) is a way to send email using the TCP/IP protocol. This is the easiest way to get notified when alerts are triggered. Use the following configuration to set up SMTP notification.

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id-smtp",
  "type": "smtp",
  "data": {
    "recipients": ["RECIPIENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS"],
    "hostname": "smtp.mail.com",
    "port": 587,
    "username": "SMTP_USERNAME",
    "password": "SMTP_PASSWORD"
  }
}
```

| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ID         | Notification identity number                                         | `Smtp12345`                                     |
| Type       | Notification types                                                   | `smtp`                                          |
| Recipients | An array of email addresses that will receive the e-mail from Monika | `["monika@testmail.com", "symon@testmail.com"]` |
| Hostname   | The smtp host that you will be using for sending the email           | `smtp.gmail.com`                                |
| Port       | The port allowed to be used for sending mail in your host            | `587`                                           |
| Username   | Registered username on your smtp server                              | `yourusername@gmail.com`                        |
| Password   | The password set for your username                                   | `thepasswordforyourusername`                    |

### Example using Gmail SMTP

To use Gmail SMTP with Monika,

1. You need to have a Gmail account.
2. Use `smtp.gmail.com` for `hostname`.
3. Use `587` for `port`.
4. Use your Gmail address for `username`.
5. Use your Gmail password for `password`. If you have activated 2-Factor-Authentication (2FA), you need to [create an App Password from your Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security). Then use the app password for `password`.

## Mailgun

Mailgun is an email notification delivery provided by Mailgun email service. To use mailgun for your notification, you
would need a mailgun account to obtain your API_KEY and DOMAIN. Please consult [mailgun documentation here](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart.html) on how to obtain them. Once that done, you could use the API_KEY and DOMAIN in monika's json configuration as follows;

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id-mailgun",
  "type": "mailgun",
  "data": {
    "recipients": ["RECIPIENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS"],
    "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "domain": "YOUR_DOMAIN"
  }
}
```

| Key        | Description                                                                  | Example                                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ID         | Notification identity number                                                 | `Mailgun12345`                                  |
| Type       | Notification types                                                           | `mailgun`                                       |
| Recipients | An array of email addresses that will receive the e-mail from Monika         | `["monika@testmail.com", "symon@testmail.com"]` |
| Api Key    | Mailgun's account api key, mailgun's registered key to identify your account | `MAILGUN_API_KEY`                               |
| Domain     | The domain to set in Mailgun                                                 | `sandboxmail.mailgun.com`                       |

## Sendgrid

Similar to mailgun, sendgrid is also an email delivery service. First, sign up for an account in sendgrid and get the API key. Please check [sendgrid's documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/). Then put the API key in Monika's configuration as follows.

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id-sendgrid",
  "type": "sendgrid",
  "data": {
    "recipients": ["RECIPIENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS"],
    "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}
```

| Key        | Description                                                                  | Example                                         |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ID         | Notification identity number                                                 | `Sendgrid12345`                                 |

| Recipients | An array of email addresses that will receive the e-mail from Monika         | `["monika@testmail.com", "symon@testmail.com"]` |
| Api Key    | Mailgun's account api key, mailgun's registered key to identify your account | `70e34aba-0ea908325`                            |

## Webhook

Monika supports Webhook. To enable notification via Webhook.

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id-webhook",
  "type": "webhook",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"
  }
}
```

| Key  | Description                                                      | Example                           |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ID   | Notification identity number                                     | `Webhook12345`                    |
| Type | Notification types                                               | `webhook`                         |
| Url  | The URL of the server that will receive the webhook notification | `https://yourwebsite.com/webhook` |

Using the webhook type configuration, `Monika` will send a request with the following body:

```js
body: {
  url: string
  time: string
  alert: string
}
```

## Slack Incoming Webhook

Monika supports Slack Incoming Webhook. To enable notification via Slack, you must have a `Slack's Incoming Webhook URL`, which you can see in their own documentation to get that. Please see [Sending messages using Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id-slack",
  "type": "slack",
  "data": {
    "url": "https://YOUR_SLACK_INCOMING_WEBHOOK_URL"
  }
}
```

| Key  | Description                            | Example                            |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
