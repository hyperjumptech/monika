title: Probes
---

Probes are the heart of the monitoring requests. Probes are arrays of request objects defined in the config file `monika.yml` like so.

```yaml
probes:
  - id: '1'
    name: Name of the probe
    description: Probe to check GET time
    interval: 10
    requests:
      - {}
    alerts: []
  - id: '2'
    name: Name of the probe 2
    description: Probe to check GET health
    interval: 10
    requests:
      - {}
    alerts: []
```

Monika goes through each probe object, sends it out, and determines whether an alert or notification need to be sent out.

## Probe Request Anatomy

An actual probe request may be something like below.

```yaml
  probes: [
    id: '1'
    name: 'Example: get Time'
    description: Probe
    interval: 10
    requests:
    - method: POST
      url: https://mybackend.org/user/login
      timeout: 7000
      saveBody: true
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkhlbGxvIGZyb20gSHlwZXJqdW1wIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.T2SbP1G39CMD4MMfkOZYGFgNIQgNkyi0sPdiFi_DfVA
      body:
        username: someusername
        password: somepassword
      alerts: ARRAY-HERE
    incidentThreshold: 3
    recoveryThreshold: 3
    alerts:
    - query: response.status != 200
      message: HTTP response status is {{ response.status }}, expecting 200
  ]
```

Details of the field are give in the table below.

| recoveryThreshold (optional) | Number of times an alert should return false before Monika sends notifications. For example, when recoveryThreshold is 3, Monika will only send notifications when the probed URL returns status 2xx 3 times in a row. After sending the notifications, Monika will not send notifications anymore until the alert status changes. Default value is 5.    |

| saveBody (optional)          | When set to true, the response body of the request is stored in the internal database. The default is off when not defined. This is to keep the log files size small as some responses can be sizeable. The setting is for each probe request.                                                                                                            |

## Probe Response Anatomy

The default shape of a response when Monika has successfully fetched a request is as the following.

```yaml
status: 200
statusText: OK
headers:
  test-header: ...
config:
  url: https://reqres.in/api/users
  method: GET
  data:
    mydata: value
  headers:
    Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
    User-Agent: axios/0.21.1
data: ...
```

Details of the fields are shown in the table below.

| Topic      | Description                                                             |
| :--------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| status     | HTTP Status Code (e.g 200, 403, 500)                                    |
| statusText | HTTP Status Code Explanation (e.g OK, Forbidden, Internal Server Error) |
| config     | Request configuration (e.g URL, Method, Data, Headers, Body, etc.)      |
| headers    | Response headers from the fetched request (e.g SetCookie, ETag, etc.).  |
| data       | Response payload from the fetched request (e.g token, results, data).   |

Probe response data could be used for [Request Chaining](https://hyperjumptech.github.io/monika/guides/examples#requests-chaining).

## Execution order

In a configuration with multiple probes, `Monika` will perform the requests in sequence in the order that they are entered, one after another. When the `--id` flag is used, the sequence of IDs are executed as entered.

On completion, `Monika` will sleep until the next interval to start again. At the top of the `monika.yml` file there is an `interval` setting. The execution will be restarted after every `interval`. If interval is shorter than the amount of time to dispatch all the requests, then `Monika` will immediately repeat after the last probe response and any notification alerts sent. When the `--repeat` flag is set with a value, Monika will not run indefinitely, instead, it will stop after executing the probes as many times as specified.

## Content-Type header

Currently, Monika only supports Content-Type value `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `application/json` with UTF-8 encoding.

## Request Body

By default, request body will be treated as-is. If request header's `Content-Type` is set to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, it will be serialized into URL-safe string in UTF-8 encoding.

## Postman JSON file support

To run monika using a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) JSON file, use `--postman` flag as follows:

```bash
monika --postman <path_to_postman_file>
```

## Insomnia file support

Monika supports [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) collection file in **version 4** format. Both `json` and `yaml` files are supported.
To run Monika using an Insomnia collection file, use `--insomnia` flag as follows:

```bash
monika --insomnia <path_to_insomnia_file>
```

## HAR file support

HAR [HTTP-Archive](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)>) format was created by the Web Performance Working Group and has become the standard in browser archive request data definition. To run monika using a HAR file, use `--har` flag as follows:

```bash
monika --har <path_to_HAR_file>
```
