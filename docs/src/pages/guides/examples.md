## Minimal Configuration

Here is a probe example with GET request to hit github.com:

```yaml
probes:
  - requests:
      - url: https://github.com
```

If you didn't define the http method, it will use the GET method by default. Please note that with this configuration, you will not get any notifications when the site github.com is down since the notification configuration is not defined.

## Enabling Notification

Here is a probe example to monitor Monika landing page:

```yaml
notifications:
  - id: unique-id-smtp
    type: smtp
    data:
      recipients:
        - YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE
      hostname: smtp.gmail.com
      port: 587
      username: YOUR_GMAIL_ACCOUNT
      password: YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD_OR_APP_PASSWORD
probes:
  - id: '1'
    name: Monika Landing Page
    description: Landing page of awesome Monika
    interval: 10
    requests:
      - url: https://hyperjumptech.github.io/monika
        timeout: 7000
    alerts:
      - status-not-2xx
```

Using the above configuration, Monika will check the landing page every 10 seconds and will send a notification by email when the landing page is down 5 times in a row. For more information about available notification channels, refer to [Notifications](https://hyperjumptech.github.io/monika/guides/notifications).

## HTML Form Submission Example

Here is probe example with POST request to simulate HTML form submission

```yaml
probes:
  - id: '1'
    name: HTML form submission
    description: simulate html form submission
    interval: 10
    requests:
      - method: POST
        url: http://www.foo.com/login.php
        timeout: 7000
        headers:
          Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        body:
          username: someusername
          password: somepassword
```

Using the configuration above, Monika will send a POST request to `http://www.foo.com/login.php` with the defined request's body.

## Multiple request

Here is an example configuration with multiple requests:

```yaml
probes:
  - id: '1'
    name: Probing Github
    description: simulate html form submission
    interval: 10
    requests:
      - method: GET
        url: https://github.com/
        timeout: 7000
        saveBody: false
      - method: GET
        url: https://github.com/hyperjumptech
        timeout: 7000
        saveBody: true
    incidentThreshold: 3
    recoveryThreshold: 3
    alerts:
      - status-not-2xx
      - response-time-greater-than-200-ms
```

In the configuration above, Monika will first check `https://github.com/` then `https://github.com/hyperjumptech`. If the status code of `https://github.com/` is not 2xx (e.g., 200, 201), Monika **will not** check `https://github.com/hyperjumptech`.

If there is a case where executing GET request to `https://github.com` triggers an alert, the next request will not be executed.

## Requests Chaining

Monika supports request chaining, which enables you to do multiple requests and the ability to use past responses from earlier requests. For example, after executing a GET request to certain API, the next request could use the previous request(s) response into their path/query parameters or headers.

Here is an example on how you could get previous request(s) response data into your next request:

```shell
{{ response.[0].status }} ==> Get status code from first request response
{{ response.[1].body.token }} ==> Get token from second request response
{{ response.[2].headers.SetCookie[0] }} ==> Get first cookie from third request response
```

In the example above, `response.[0]` refers to the response from the first request in the probe, `response.[1]` refers to the response from the second request in the probe, and so on. Please note that you can only use the response from previous requests in the same probe.

Please refer to [Probe Response Anatomy](https://hyperjumptech.github.io/monika/guides/probes#probe-response-anatomy) in order to know which value could be used from the response body for the next request(s).

In the sections below, you can find several examples of configuration file which contains chaining requests.

### Pass Response Data as Path/Query Parameters

Here is an example of using previous request's response in the path/query parameters:

```yaml
probes:
  - id: '1'
    name: Probing Github
    description: simulate html form submission
    interval: 10
    requests:
      - method: GET
        url: https://reqres.in/api/users
        timeout: 7000
      - method: GET
        url: https://reqres.in/api/users/{{ responses.[0].body.data.[0].id }}
        timeout: 7000
    incidentThreshold: 3
    recoveryThreshold: 3
    alerts:
      - status-not-2xx
      - response-time-greater-than-2000-ms
```

In the configuration above, the first request will fetch all users from `https://reqres.in/api/users`. Then in the second request, Monika will fetch the details of the first user from the first request. If there are no triggered alerts, the response returned from the first request is ready to be used by the second request using values from `{{ responses.[0].body }}`.

Let's say the response from fetching all users in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
  "page": 2,
  "per_page": 6,
  "total": 12,
  "total_pages": 2,
  "data": [
    {
        "id": 7,
        "email": "michael.lawson@reqres.in",
        "first_name": "Michael",
        "last_name": "Lawson",
        "avatar": "https://reqres.in/img/faces/7-image.jpg"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

To use the user ID of the first user in the second request, we define the url of the second request as `{{ responses.[0].body.data.[0].id }}`.

### Pass Response Data as Headers value

Here is an example of using previous request's response in the headers:

```yaml
probes:
  - id: '1'
    name: Probing Github
    description: simulate html form submission
    interval: 10
    requests:
      - method: POST
        url: https://reqres.in/api/login
        timeout: 7000
        body:
          email: eve.holt@reqres.in
          password: cityslicka
      - method: POST
        url: https://reqres.in/api/users/
        timeout: 7000
        body:
          name: morpheus
          job: leader
        headers:
          Authorization: Bearer {{ responses.[0].body.token }}
    incidentThreshold: 3
    recoveryThreshold: 3
    alerts:
      - status-not-2xx
      - response-time-greater-than-2000-ms
```

Using the above configuration, Monika will perform login request in the first request, then use the returned token in the Authorization header of the second request.
